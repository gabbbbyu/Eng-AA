            <p><strong>Description</strong><br>
              Wasted Potential is the refusal to try, grow, or pursue opportunities. It wastes innate talents,
              abandons dreams, and traps individuals in lives defined by "what could have been."
            </p>

            <p><strong>Punishment</strong><br>
              Souls stand in a dark void filled with floating doors representing missed opportunities. Whenever
              they reach for a door, it vanishes. The ground beneath them crumbles whenever they hesitate,
              sending them plummeting endlessly, trapped in the consequences of their own inaction.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Allegory</strong><br>
              The void and disappearing doors symbolize lost chances and unrealized potential. Their endless
              falling shows that avoiding action leads to perpetual regret and stagnation—a life forever defined
              by what was never attempted.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Reflection</strong><br>
              These sins show how modern society struggles with procrastination and avoidance, often choosing
              comfort over responsibility, even when it harms others. The circle of Sloth feels important to me
              because I relate to the pressure of time slipping away and the consequences of delaying important
              tasks. Through this version of the Inferno, I want readers to understand that wasted time cannot be
              reclaimed and that facing responsibilities today prevents heavier burdens tomorrow.
