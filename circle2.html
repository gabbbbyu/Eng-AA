            <p><strong>Description</strong><br>
              Sloth is the choice of comfort and avoidance over action. It wastes potential, breaks commitments,
              and forces others to bear the consequences of one's inaction.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Punishment</strong><br>
              Souls are trapped waist-deep in sticky mud, pulled backward by shadowy figures representing
              abandoned responsibilities. Glowing clocks above speed up whenever they hesitate, threatening
              to drag them under entirely.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Allegory</strong><br>
              The mud and shadows symbolize the weight of excuses and ignored duties. The speeding clocks
              remind that time lost can never be regained, showing that delay only deepens one's downfall.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Reflection</strong><br>
              These sins show how modern society struggles with procrastination and avoidance, often choosing
              comfort over responsibility even when it harms others. The circle of Sloth feels important to me
              because I relate to the pressure of time slipping away and the consequences of delaying important
              tasks. Through this version of the Inferno, I want readers to understand that wasted time cannot be
              reclaimed and that facing responsibilities today prevents heavier burdens tomorrow.
