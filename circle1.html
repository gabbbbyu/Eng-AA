            <p><strong>Description</strong><br>
              This sin is committed by people who use words, either spoken, written, or online, to harm others. 
              Through gossip, lies, insults, and digital attacks, they damaged reputations, caused emotional pain, 
              and used communication as a weapon.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Punishment</strong><br>
              Their tongues are chained with fire, and whenever they try to speak, their own cruel words turn into 
              burning creatures that bite and lash at them. Every message or post they wrote becomes a fiery serpent 
              that coils around their body, stabbing them endlessly.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Allegory</strong><br>
              Their punishment shows that harmful speech comes back to destroy the speaker. The serpents and burning 
              words symbolize how cruelty spreads and eventually consumes the one who created it.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Reflection</strong><br>
              These sins reveal how easily people today weaponize communication, online gossip, insults, or careless 
              posts can spread faster and cut deeper than ever before. I personally connect most with this circle 
              because harmful words, once released, are impossible to take back, and many people underestimate the 
              damage they can do. From this Inferno, I hope readers learn that every word carries weight and that 
              using speech responsibly is both a moral duty and a form of compassion.
